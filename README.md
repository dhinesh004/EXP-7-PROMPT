# Aim: To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Objective:

To illustrate the creation of a prompt-based assistant for handling daily tasks, planning, and productivity. This includes a step-by-step transition from basic commands to advanced, context-aware prompts that emulate intelligent assistant behaviours.

Procedure:

Step 1: Determine a Specific Use Case
Define the specific need the application will address. Possible examples include:
a. Daily schedule manager b. Health or workout tracker c. Academic planner d. Mood and habit monitor e. Writing assistant
In this case, we’ll design a Daily Task Scheduler.
Step 2: Establish Core Functionality
Begin with a basic prompt that outlines the primary task.

Example Prompt (Simple):

Prompt:

“Help me plan today’s activities: call mom, finish reading assignment, yoga session at 5 PM.”
Expected Output:
•	Call mom 
•	Finish reading assignment
•	Yoga session at 5 PM
Step 3: Enhance Prompt with Personal Context
Add relevant details such as available time, preferences, and output format.

Improved Prompt:

Prompt:

“Create a day schedule from 8 AM to 5 PM including short breaks. I want to prioritize mental tasks in the morning and physical ones in the afternoon. Tasks:
Call mom
Read for exam
Yoga at 5 PM”

Expected Output:

Daily Schedule:

8:00 AM – 9:00 AM: Read for exam
9:00 AM – 9:15 AM: Break
9:15 AM – 10:00 AM: Read for exam (continued)
10:00 AM – 10:30 AM: Call mom
10:30 AM – 12:00 PM: Free/Buffer
12:00 PM – 1:00 PM: Lunch
1:00 PM – 4:30 PM: Free time or errands
5:00 PM – 6:00 PM: Yoga session
Step 4: Expand Prompt with Intelligent Features
Introduce motivational aspects, helpful reminders, and context-aware scheduling.

Advanced Prompt:

Prompt:

“Using my preference for doing cognitive tasks early and physical ones later, make a schedule from 8 AM to 5 PM with breaks every 1.5 hours. Include a motivational quote before each main task. Tasks:
Work on project
Grocery shopping
Yoga session at 5 PM
20-minute journal writing”

Expected Output:

Smart Schedule:
 "The secret of getting ahead is getting started."
8:00 AM – 10:00 AM: Work on project
10:00 AM – 10:15 AM: Break
  "Small habits make a big difference."
10:15 AM – 10:45 AM: Journal writing
   "Progress is achieved by effort and persistence."
11:00 AM – 12:00 PM: Grocery shopping
12:00 PM – 1:00 PM: Lunch break
   "Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live."
5:00 PM – 6:00 PM: Yoga session
Step 5: Emulate an Interactive Experience
Simulate the feel of an actual productivity app using conversational prompts.

Initial Prompt: User: “Help me set up my tasks for today.”
Model: “Sure! Could you list the tasks you have, your available hours, and how you'd like your day to be structured?”
Follow-up User Input: “Tasks: Prepare slides, doctor appointment at 1 PM, dishes. Time: 9 AM – 4 PM. Prefer focused work first, chores later.”

Output:

Interactive Plan:

9:00 AM – 11:00 AM: Prepare slides
11:00 AM – 11:15 AM: Break
11:15 AM – 12:00 PM: Final touches on slides
12:00 PM – 12:45 PM: Dishes
1:00 PM – 2:00 PM: Doctor appointment
2:00 PM – 4:00 PM: Free or follow-up tasks
Step 6: Develop Personalized Prompt Templates Create adaptable prompts that simulate personalization and reuse.
Reusable Prompt: Prompt: “Using my standard format, make today’s schedule with these tasks: attend lecture, clean room, 30-minute jog. Include time blocks and quick productivity tips.”

Output:

Personalized Schedule:

8:30 AM – 10:00 AM: Attend lecture
Tip: Take handwritten notes to retain concepts better.
10:00 AM – 10:15 AM: Short break
10:15 AM – 11:00 AM: Clean room
Tip: Play upbeat music to stay energized.
11:00 AM – 11:30 AM: Jog
Tip: Use this time to mentally reset and stay active.

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates how language models such as ChatGPT can be effectively used to build personalized, prompt-based tools that adapt to individual routines. By gradually evolving prompt complexity, users can design their own virtual assistants with increasing intelligence—all without programming.
This approach not only enhances creativity but also develops logical thinking and efficiency in prompt crafting.
